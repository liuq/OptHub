# OptHub

[Optimization Hub](https://opthub.uniud.it) is a respository of problem instances and solutions for optimization problems.

The main purpose of the repository is to keep track of certified (i.e., valid and timestamped) solutions for optimization problems along with their authors in order to foster results comparability and reproducibility in this research area.

It complements other problem repositories, such as [OR-Library](http://www.brunel.ac.uk/~mastjjb/jeb/info.html) and [CSPLib](http://csplib.org/), so that also problem solutions are managed and retained in the system.

This is the page for supporting OptHub. If you experience problems with the tool you can enter a [new issue](https://github.com/liuq/OptHub/issues/new).
